CALCULATOR USER GUIDE:
---------------------

The calculator application serves as a tool to calculate basic arithmetic using integer or numbers, with operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It will follow order of operations, and parenthesis can be used to specify order aswell.

To do a simple calculation, type in the respective equation using numbers OR variables, and operators. To output the result, end the statement with a semicolon- ";". This will print out the respective output.

To create and store data in a variable, type "let", then the variable name (which can use any letters, numbers, or underscores), then the equal sign- "=", and finally the expression to represent its value.

To create and store data in a constant variable, follow the same steps as for creating a variable but use the keyword "const" instead of using the keyword "let".

To modify the value of a variable at any point, simply type the variable name, the equals sign- "=", and the new expression to represent its value. This will replace the existing value. This will not work for variables declared as a constant, and will throw an error.

To quit the program at any time, type "Q" and it will exit.
